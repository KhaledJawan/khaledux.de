Many people in Afghanistan are cautious when it comes to adopting new technology, so the product needed to be exceptionally clear, trustworthy, and easy to use. My focus in the design process was on: <br/>Very simple interaction flows (minimal steps & clear icons). <br/>Strong sense of safety and transparency (driver identity, route preview, upfront pricing). <br/>This approach made Buber accessible to a wide range of users, including those who had little or no previous experience with smartphone apps. The platform helped build confidence in digital services and contributed to the early growth of app-based mobility in Afghanistan.",
